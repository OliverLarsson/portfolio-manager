CSCI 3010 - Individual Project 

Hi! Welcome to my individual project for CSCI 3010 at CU Boulder. This is a automated Portfolio Manager game that takes your real attributes and matches it with real financial assets. It will also forecast the expected growth of your portfolio based on historical trends. 

DISCLAIMER: I do not have any rights, licenses, or exceptional knowledge that warrants any of this to be legitimate financial advise. Do NOT use it as a reliable source for financial planning. :) 

That being said... have fun with it! To download the game, follow these steps on your command line after installing git: (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

    1. git clone https://github.com/OliverLarsson/portfolio-manager 
    2. cd portfolio-manager

Once you complete the downloading steps, it's time to play. To run the game, make sure you are in the portfolio-manager directory, then follow these steps on the command line: 

    1. make all
    2. ./portfolio

If you want to test the game, follow these steps on the command line: 

    1. make all 
    2. ./test

Have fun!

Framer X mockup: 
    - Framer X is a software that allows you to draw, style, and export responsive mockups. Used by companies like Twitter, Dropbox, and YouTube, it comes with loads of features both locally and in the Framer X store, giving you plenty of options in designing the product. Personally, I found it extremely useful and intuitive. Going through the several page tutorial that is offered upon launching the app gave me everything I needed to effectively design my Portfolio Manager and create links between all the pages. 
    - As far as viewing the Framer X document, you'll need to download the software. It comes with a 14-day free trial with no card needed, so you don't have to worry about accidentally forgetting to cancel the subscription and getting charged. Here's their site: https://framer.com/
    - I'll also be uploading a PDF of the mockup into the Checkpoints folder on GitHub so it's viewable without the software.
