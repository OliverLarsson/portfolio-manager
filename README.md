# portfolio-manager
CSCI 3010 - Individual Project 

Hi! Welcome to my individual project for CSCI 3010 at CU Boulder. This is a automated Portfolio Manager game that takes your real attributes and matches it with real financial assets. It will also forecast the expected growth of your portfolio based on historical trends. 

DISCLAIMER: I do not have any rights, licenses, or exceptional knowledge that warrants any of this to be legitimate financial advise. Do NOT use it as a reliable source for financial planning. :) 

That being said... have fun with it! To download the game, follow these steps on your command line after installing git: (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

    1. git clone https://github.com/OliverLarsson/portfolio-manager 
    2. cd portfolio-manager

Once you complete the downloading steps, it's time to play. To run the game, make sure you are in the portfolio-manager directory, then follow these steps on the command line: 

    1. make all
    2. ./portfolio

If you want to test the game, follow these steps on the command line: 

    1. make all 
    2. ./test

Have fun!
